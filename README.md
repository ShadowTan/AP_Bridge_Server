# AP_Bridge_Server
 This project will be about making the a local version of the game Bridge using RESTapi, to be played against bots.

PS. Currently has no ERROR handling, so avoid from, example: asking for info about a game that does not exist

### info
All valid API calls are in the API_Requests.http file

Thanks!
